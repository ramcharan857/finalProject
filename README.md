# IMPLEMENTATION OF SHA256 ALGORITHM

## Required Answer
For the text provided in the link : https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=DIV1&byte=4697892

The following is it's hash value:
```bash
8d202adf39c3e88510a591cbe1cbd96708e3237140060c0768f2577f9d81d3ad
```
## How to hash the text

- Place your required text in the file named requiredText.txt
- Compile the sha256.cpp fie as follow:
```bash
g++ sha256.cpp -o sha
```
- Run the binary file
```bash
./sha
```
## Output
You should see an output something like this
```text
SHA-256 hash of requiredText.txt: 8d202adf39c3e88510a591cbe1cbd96708e3237140060c0768f2577f9d81d3ad
